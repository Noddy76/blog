I am a developer working with Java on Hadoop.

At home I am interested in home automation using it as a vehicle to learn new technologies in software development and electronics.

I can be reached by email at [james@queeg.org](mailto:james@queeg.org) and found
on [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jamesggrant),
[GitHub](https://github.com/Noddy76) and very occasionally on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/noddy_uk).
